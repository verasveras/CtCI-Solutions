# CtCI-Solutions
Working through problems in the 5th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview. 
- Most solutions are in C++, some are in C. Comments provided on the top of each solution will state which language.
- Solution files (e.g. 1-1.cpp) are written so that they will run indivually with no file dependance other than standard C/C++ library files. This means that some files contain duplicate code.
- For the first version of these solutions, class implementations are incomplete. There will be no provided destructors, so allocated memory will be leaked.
